# SAMCoreImageView

Render a CIImage in an OpenGL thingy so it's real fast and junk. You won't see any speed up on the simulator, but on the device it's nuts fast.

This is was inspired by [TLDFastCoreImageView](https://github.com/patr1ck/TLDCoreImageDemo/blob/master/TLDCoreImageDemo/TLDFastCoreImageView.h) by [Patrick Gibson](https://github.com/patr1ck). Thanks Patrick!


## Usage

``` objc
SAMCoreImageView *imageView = [[SAMCoreImageView alloc] init];
imageView.image = [someFilter outputImage];
```

SAMCoreImageView's `contentMode` behaves just like UIImageView's so go nuts. Internally, it uses [SAMContentMode](https://github.com/soffes/SAMContentMode) to do its magic.


## Running the Example

`cd` into the `Example` directory and run `pod install`. Then open `Example.xcworkspace` and build like normal. The performance on the simulator isn't great. Try it on a device.


## Limitations

The only thing SAMCoreImageView doesn't do well is resizing. If you need to resize the view, I recommend destroying it and making a new one for now. I started working on a fix for this, but couldn't get it to work right just yet.
